# MusFi

Reviving this project because still after nearly 3 years because, I think, the world is not paying attention this technology deserves.

## About the Project

Imagine a place with no wires, no routers or modems whatsoever, isn't that inspiring? After I stumbled across Light Fidelity or more commonly called LiFi in short is a wireless technology that uses light rather than radio frequencies to transmit data.

The purpose of transmitting music over the Visible Light Spectrum other than finding a healthier alternative to radio waves as wireless data transmission medium was as Music streaming has becoming very popular, using LiFi to send data would increase the bandwidth dramatically as Light spectrum is ~ 10,000 times broader than the Radio spectrum, providing far greater bandwidth than WiFi. Also, the transmission speed is much greater reaching almost 224 gigabits per second (Gbps) at lab conditions. ([Beyond 100-Gb/s Indoor Wide Field-of-View

In case you're wondering why it is a healthier alternative, because it works on Visible Light Spectrum, it emits no radiation and causes no exposure to electromagnetic fields.

Theoretically, it may handle the tremendously growing internet population, it can also control the increasing frequency of wireless dead spots.

## Project Origin

It all started when I read about IEEE Maker Project 2017. What intrigued me the most was that IEEE Maker Project contest gave an opportunity to show the world the work that has been keeping me up at night, tirelessly tinkering with a tech project that solves complex problems and has applications to benefit society.

> The Project got the most upvotes and topped in it's category e.g. Entertainment, overall secured 15th position out of 183 projects. You can visit the project at it's infancy over [transmitter.ieee.org/makerproject/view/93538](https://transmitter.ieee.org/makerproject/view/93538)
