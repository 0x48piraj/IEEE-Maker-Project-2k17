# IEEE Maker Project 2017

![](http://theinstitute.ieee.org/image/MTYyNzEz.jpeg)


> If you’ve been tinkering with a tech project that could have applications in the real world, here’s your chance to show off your work: The IEEE Maker Project contest is now open to anyone 18 years or older.

> Makers can submit their entry to the IEEE Transmitter website. Project categories include health and safety, education, entertainment, and transportation. A panel of judges will rate the projects based on three criteria: originality, innovation, and benefit to humanity. The deadline to submit entries is 17 October.

> Finalists in each category receive an Amazon gift card worth US $50 in their local currency, and their projects will be featured on IEEE Transmitter. The grand-prize winner will receive a $500 Amazon gift card and an hour-long mentoring session with an IEEE member.

**What intrigued me the most !**

> **This is your opportunity to show the world the work that has been keeping you up at night. So, if you are tirelessly tinkering with a tech project that solves complex problems and has applications to benefit society, and want to win great prizes, we want to hear from you.**

# My Project !

## Transmit music over the Visible Light Spectrum using Li-Fi.

> Imagine a place with no-wires/routers/modems Whatsoever!

**Worth Investing ! Right ?**

> **Light Fidelity (Li-Fi)** is an emerging **Super-Fast**, **Super-Sexy** technology that can be implemented in every aspect of **Data-Transmission** and probably, is the **Key of Future Communication !**

## The Purpose
### Purpose #1 :

> Other than Wi-Fi or any current transmission networks, LiFi is the **Healthier-Alternative**.

### `How ?`

> Because, it works on **Visible Light Spectrum**. 

### `So ?`

> *So...* 

* **No radiation !**
* **No EMF exposure !**

---

### Purpose #2 :

> Nowadays, **Music Streaming** is becoming very popular.

### `Yes !! So ?`

> And So, My Project is **Near-Perfect Solution** for this.

### `Really ! How ?`

> Because **Light Spectrum** is 10,000 times broader than the **Radio Spectrum**, providing greater bandwidth than WiFi.

One more supporting factor is, that Li-Fi is blazingly fast ! 224 gigabits per second! or say, 18 BlueRay quality movies in one second !! And, So it may handle the tremendously growing internet population. Other than these, Li-Fi can also control the increasing frequency of Dead-Spots(Internet-Failures).
