# IEEE Maker Project 2017

![](http://theinstitute.ieee.org/image/MTYyNzEz.jpeg)


> If you’ve been tinkering with a tech project that could have applications in the real world, here’s your chance to show off your work: The IEEE Maker Project contest is now open to anyone 18 years or older.

> Makers can submit their entry to the IEEE Transmitter website. Project categories include health and safety, education, entertainment, and transportation. A panel of judges will rate the projects based on three criteria: originality, innovation, and benefit to humanity. The deadline to submit entries is 17 October.

> Finalists in each category receive an Amazon gift card worth US $50 in their local currency, and their projects will be featured on IEEE Transmitter. The grand-prize winner will receive a $500 Amazon gift card and an hour-long mentoring session with an IEEE member.

**What intrigued me the most !**

> **This is your opportunity to show the world the work that has been keeping you up at night. So, if you are tirelessly tinkering with a tech project that solves complex problems and has applications to benefit society, and want to win great prizes, we want to hear from you.**
